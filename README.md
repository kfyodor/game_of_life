# Conway's Game of Life

[Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) implementation in [Clojure](http://clojure.org) using [Quil](https://github.com/quil/quil) for rendering. This is my first try so it's extremely inefficient and there's still a lot of work to do (I really want to implement a [hashlife](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashlife) algorithm, for expmple).
